          It looks like a prank, but the anatomy of the platypus is a marvel of evolution.
          Here are the specs on nature's most unique build:

        <h2>The Stats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Size:</strong> They typically grow to about 40–50 cm (15–20 inches) long.
            That's roughly the size of a house cat or small dog!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weight:</strong> Ranging from 0.7 kg to 2.4 kg (1.5–5.3 lbs), with males
            generally being larger than females. About the weight of a pineapple or a bag of sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lifespan:</strong> In the wild, they can live up to 12 years. In captivity,
            they've been known to reach the ripe old age of 17!
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section className="content-section">
        <h2>Relative Size Comparisons</h2>
        <p>
          To put their size in perspective:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Length:</strong> Similar to a large ruler or a small skateboard</li>
          <li><strong>Weight:</strong> About the same as 3-4 cans of soda or a small laptop</li>
          <li><strong>Body:</strong> Comparable to a football (American) in girth when swimming</li>
          <li><strong>Bill:</strong> About 7-8 cm long, roughly the size of a credit card</li>
          <li><strong>Tail:</strong> 10-15 cm, similar to a dollar bill's length</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Males are typically 30% larger than females, making them about the size of a small
          terrier dog, while females are closer to the size of a large guinea pig.

        <h2>Superpowers & Features</h2>

        <h3>The Bill</h3>
        <p>
          It's not hard like a bird's beak! It's actually rubbery and soft, acting as a sensory
          organ to detect prey.
        </p>

        <h3>The Coat</h3>
        <p>
          Their dense, waterproof fur has two layers to keep them warm and dry, even after hours
          in chilly river water.
        </p>

        <h3>The Breath</h3>
        <p>
          Even though they are master swimmers, they are mammals and breathe air using lungs.
          They hold their breath while diving, usually for 30-60 seconds at a time.
        </p>

        <h3>Danger Mode</h3>
        <p>
          Watch out for the males! They possess a hollow spur on their hind ankles connected to
          a venom gland. It's their secret weapon against rivals.
