        <p>
          At Club Puggle, we know our favorite animal is one of a kind, but what does science say?
          The Platypus is a biological anomaly. While they might look like a collage of different
          animals glued together, they have a very specific place in the tree of life.

        <p>
          The platypus belongs to the order Monotremata. This is an exclusive VIP club for
          mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The only other member?
          The Echidna.

        <h2>Species Status</h2>
        <p>
          There is only one primary species of Platypus still swimming today. While there are
          slight size differences depending on whether they live in Northern or Southern Australia,
          they are all part of the same big, weird family.
