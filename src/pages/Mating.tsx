          This is where the Platypus truly earns its fame. As a Monotreme, the female platypus
          lays eggs rather than giving birth to live young.

        <p>
          After mating, the female carries the eggs for 2–3 weeks. Once she lays them, she curls
          around them to keep them warm.

        <p>
          The incubation period is short—only about 10 days until they hatch!

        <h2>The Puggles</h2>
        <p>
          A typical clutch consists of 1 to 3 eggs (though 2 is the magic number). When they
          hatch, we call the babies Puggles.

        <h2>Growing Up</h2>
        <p>
          Puggles are about the size of a jellybean when they hatch. They stay in the burrow,
          drinking milk from patches on their mother's skin (she has no nipples!), for 3–4 months
          before they are ready to face the world.
