        <h2>The Hunt (Sixth Sense)</h2>
        <p>
          When a platypus dives, it closes its eyes, ears, and nose. So how does it find food?
          It uses Electroreception. Its bill detects the tiny electrical currents made by the
          muscles of shrimp and worms hiding in the mud. It's basically hunting with a built-in
          metal detector!

        <h2>Self Defense</h2>
        <p>
          The platypus might look cute, but it can hold its own. Males use their venomous spurs
          to fight off rivals during mating season. For predators, their best defense is their
          dark brown fur (which camouflages them in muddy water) and their ability to quickly
          disappear into underwater burrows.

        <h2>The Schedule</h2>
        <p>
          Platypuses are mostly nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk). They take
          their rest seriously, sleeping up to 14 hours a day inside their burrows to conserve
          energy for their next swim.
