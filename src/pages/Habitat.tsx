          You won't find a platypus climbing trees or walking down a city street. These shy
          creatures are strictly locals of Eastern Australia and Tasmania.

          To thrive, a platypus needs a very specific setup. They require freshwater systems—think
          rivers, lagoons, and streams—surrounded by earth banks.

          They spend roughly 12 hours a day patrolling the water for food.

          When they aren't swimming, they retire to elaborate burrows dug into the riverbanks
          just above the water level. These burrows are often hidden behind tree roots to keep
          them safe from prying eyes.
